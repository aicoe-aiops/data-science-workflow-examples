    "Logs are an effective source of data to understand system health and behavior. However, they can often be long and noisy, which makes it difficult for a human to manually analyze them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, the [LogPAI](https://github.com/logpai) team developed an online log parsing algorithm called [Drain](https://github.com/logpai/logparser/blob/e8d96cd4de1121c5d2b517982c6028cd06e643f1/docs/tools/Drain.md), that parses logs to extract \"log templates\" from them. Using these log templates instead of raw logs makes it much easier and faster to analyze log data. The IBM research team then upgraded the official implementation of this project, added some new features and bugfixes, and wrapped it into a python package called [drain3](https://github.com/IBM/Drain3).\n",
